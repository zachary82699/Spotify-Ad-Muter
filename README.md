# Why Did I Make This
I decided to create this script because I couldn't afford Spotify Premium and I hate blocking ads. Yes, some ads are shitty, but a majority of ads are fine and running advertisements help offset server costs.

# How It Works
This script automatically mutes and unmutes Spotify when ads play. It does this by checking for specific application titles (Advertisement, Spotify Free, Spotify, etc).

# Is This Legal?
Recently, Spotify has been cracking down on ad blocking with their products, they changed their Terms of Service to not allow circumventing/blocking advertisements [Spotify User guidelines](HTTPS://www.Spotify.com/us/legal/end-user-agreement/). This script simply mutes the Spotify.exe process and doesn't remove/block a single ad. Also, there have been cases where people have been banned by Spotify for blocking ads. So, Block Ads At Your Own Risk, I am not responsible if you get banned for blocking ads. :)

# Privacy Enhancements
If you are a privacy minded individual like me that hates personalized ads and data sharing for marketing purposes, you can disable both in Spotify Account settings. Also, Absolutely DO NOT connect your Spotify account with your Facebook account, they are know to collect your data and sell it.

## Disable 'Sharing Data For Marketing Purposes'
    - Click your username in the Spotify application
    - Account
    - Login to your account
    - Edit Profile
    - Uncheck 'Share my registration data with Spotify's content providers for marketing purposes.'

## Disable 'Personal data for tailored ads'
    - Click your username in the Spotify application
    - Account
    - Login to your account
    - Privacy settings
    - Uncheck 'Process Facebook data' & Uncheck 'Process my personal data for tailored ads'
    
## Enable 'Block All Cookies' Setting
    - Click your username in the Spotify application
    - Settings
    - Click 'Show Advanced Settings'
    - Check the 'Privacy' checkbox
